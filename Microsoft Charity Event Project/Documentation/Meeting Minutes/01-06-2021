Topics discussed:
1. Doubts regarding the problem statement and the project plan that needed to be discussed with Microsoft mentors. 
   Highlights:Q.1 What all microservices will be there in our project? What approach should we follow to figure them out? Is it Domain-Driven-Design? Can we get more insights about DDD?

              Q.3 What are the user stories going to be? (Should we ask this one or not?)
